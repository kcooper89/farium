React Google Books Homework

Welcome to my Google Books React App. 

The app is simple! 
On the top right hand side of the home page you can search for books using Google Books. 

On the top left hand side of the page is a small menu with which you can select search or saved books. 

When you find a book that you like, you can click on the link to be redirected to a page where you can purchase the book. You can also save the book for future reference by clicking the 'Save' button. 

You can view saved books on the saved page and you can view the book by clicking on the link provided or you cna remove the book by clicking the 'delete' button. 

Thank you!
